# Mobile apps: behavioral cohorts analysis

**Data description**

The dataset contains data on events performed in the "Unnecessary things" mobile application (here and hereafter, the name of the app was changed). In this app, users sell their unnecessary things by posting them on the bulletin board. The dataset contains data on users who performed actions in the application for the first time after October 7, 2019.

**Main questions of the project:**

WHICH GROUP OF USERS ARE TENDED TO RETURN TO THE MOBILE APPLICATION OFTEN (RETENTION RATE)?
WHICH GROUP OF USERS OFTEN PERFORM THE TARGET EVENT (CONVERSION TO TARGET ACTION)?

## Conclusion

**User behavior overview**

Based on the data, I can say that the first three cohorts show retention of about 25% in the second week. For users of the first cohort, it is better in the third week than for users of the second and third cohorts.

Average session duration: 4982.00 seconds (83.03 minutes). Median session duration: 708.42 seconds (11.81 minutes).

The target action with displaying contacts was performed by more than 20% of users - this is a fairly good result.

Key results: For the purposes of this study, segmentation by the source from which the user installed the application was chosen for the following reasons:

the groups are easy to divide, they definitely do not intersect with each other;

understanding from which source users install the application provides important information - based on this knowledge, you can decide which sources to direct marketing efforts to, how to build an advertising campaign, where it is worth revising approaches.

Based on the data obtained, it is clear that the retention in the second and third weeks of users who downloaded the application from other sources is higher than that of Google and Yandex users. However, the conversion to the target action is higher for users who came from Google and Yandex (almost the same), from other sources - lower, but not significatly. Thus, I believe that the target group will be a group of users who came from other sources in order to increase the conversion to the target action.

**The tested hypotheses confirm the obtained results:**

the hypothesis that the conversion of users to view contacts who came from Yandex is equal to the conversion of users to view contacts who came from Google is not rejected the null hypothesis (p â‰¥ 0.05). There are no statistically significant differences in conversions.
the hypothesis that the conversion of users to view contacts who came from other is equal to the conversion of users to view contacts who came from Google is rejected the null hypothesis (p < 0.05). Conversions are statistically significantly different.
